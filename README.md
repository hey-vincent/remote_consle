# introduction
This is a siple tcpip demo which was implemented by C++ with MFC. This project created by vs 2015.And this solution contains two projects: server and client.

# function
This demo can send data to client. And client will respond for commonds it got.Both client's and server's IP and port could be setted by files.

# what need to be improved
1.From now on the server can only manage one client at same time.\n
2.There is no result for responding of commonds. So I dont't know whether this commond was executed successfully or not.
3.The UI is based on consle. While it's not convenient. I should take measures for this.I mean I should improve the User-Experience even I still use consle as UI.
